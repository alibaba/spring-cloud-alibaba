== Spring Cloud Alibaba Dubbo

=== Introduction

Dubbo Spring Cloud is based on Dubbo Spring Boot 2.7.3[1] and Spring Cloud 2.x development, whether the developer is a Dubbo user or a Spring Cloud user.
Easily navigate and move apps up at a cost close to “zero” costs. Dubbo Spring Cloud is designed to simplify Cloud Native development costs, improve R&D performance, and improve application performance.

=== Features

Since Dubbo Spring Cloud is built on top of the native Spring Cloud, its service governance capabilities are considered Spring Cloud Plus.
Not only does it fully cover the Spring Cloud native features [5], but it also provides a more stable and mature implementation, as shown in the following table:
