== Spring Cloud Alibaba Governance

image::pic/governance-module.png[]

Spring Cloud Alibaba Governance is a Microservices governance capabilities provided by Spring Cloud Alibaba, which provides various types of microservices governance capabilities, including label routing, service authentication, etc. Moreover, it supports various control planes, such as https://istio.io/[Istio] and http://opensergo.io/[OpenSergo], so that users can get the governance rules in real time just adding relevant dependency, and apply these rules to applications to govern the Spring Cloud Alibaba application.


=== Resource Transform
image::pic/resource-transform.png[]

The resource-transform adapter of Microservices Governance will uniformly transform the rules published by different control planes, like Istio and OperSergo, into the unified abstract data structure of Spring Cloud Alibaba for subsequent use.

If you use Istio in your project to transform the rule, first of all, note that you need to build a Kubernetes cluster and deploy Istio in it. For details, refer to https://istio.io/latest/zh/docs/setup/install[Istio installation], you need to add a following starter dependency application:
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-xds-adapter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
If you want to use OpenSergo, you can refer to https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/tree/2.2.x/spring-cloud-alibaba-examples/governance-example/label-routing-example[Spring Cloud Alibaba Routing Examples].

There are two ways to connect to `Istio` control plane:

==== Inject pilot-agent(recommend)

Users can easily connect to the `Istio` control plane by injecting pilot-agent as a proxy for the xds protocol, simply by adding the following annotation to the pod of Spring Cloud Alibaba workload:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        inject.istio.io/templates: grpc-agent
        proxy.istio.io/config: '{"holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts": true}'
----

And enable `pilot-agent` in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
server:
  port: ${SERVER_PORT:80}
spring:
  cloud:
    governance:
      auth:
        enabled: ${ISTIO_AUTH_ENABLE:true}
    istio:
      config:
        enabled: ${ISTIO_CONFIG_ENABLE:true}
        use-agent: ${USE_AGENT:true}
----

==== Connect to istio control plane directly

Users who want to debug the code of the governance module locally can directly connect to the `Istio` control plane without injecting the pilot-agent. If `pilot-agent` is not injected, the user needs to set the following configuration contents in the `application.yml` configuration file:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
server:
  port: ${SERVER_PORT:80}
spring:
  cloud:
    governance:
      auth:
        enabled: ${ISTIO_AUTH_ENABLE:true}
    istio:
      config:
        enabled: ${ISTIO_CONFIG_ENABLE:true}
        host: ${ISTIOD_ADDR:127.0.0.1}
        port: ${ISTIOD_PORT:15010}
        pod-name: ${POD_NAME:auth-5ffd65b7b8-l8tpf}
        namespace-name: ${NAMESPACE_NAME:default}
        istiod-token: ${ISTIOD_TOKEN:}
        log-xds: ${LOG_XDS:true}
        use-agent: ${USE_AGENT:false}
----

Here's an explanation of each field:
|===
|Configuration Item|key|Default Value|Description
|Whether to enable authentication| spring.cloud.governance.auth.enabled|true|
|Whether to connect to Istio to obtain authentication configuration| spring.cloud.istio.config.enabled|true|
|Host of Istiod| spring.cloud.istio.config.host|127.0.0.1|
|Port of Istiod| spring.cloud.istio.config.port|15012|15010 port does not need TLSï¼Œbut 15012 does
|Pod name| spring.cloud.istio.config.pod-name|value of environment variable POD_NAME|
|Namespace name| spring.cloud.istio.config.namespace-name|value of environment variable NAMESPACE_NAME|
|JWT token for application to connect to 15012 port| spring.cloud.istio.config.istiod-token|Content of file `/var/run/secrets/tokens/istio-token` in the pod of application.(Only support third-part-jwt now, first-part-jwt will be supported later)|
|Whether to print logs about xDS| spring.cloud.istio.config.log-xds|true|
|Whether to inject pilot-agent| spring.cloud.istio.config.use-agent|false|
|===

If you want to connect to port 15012 of the `Istio` control plane when directly connecting the istio control plane, you need to apply `serviceaccount` as `projected volumn` mount to k8s path `/ var/run/secrets/tokens/istio-token`:

1.Apply a `projected volumn` for the pod of Spring Cloud Alibaba workload:
[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: istio-token
      projected:
        defaultMode: 420
        sources:
          - serviceAccountToken:
              audience: istio-ca
              expirationSeconds: 43200
              path: istio-token
----

2.Mount the `projected volumn` to path `/var/run/secrets/tokens/istio-token`:
[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
spec:
  containers:
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
        name: istio-token
----
If you want to emulate the identity of other workloads when debugging locally, you can fill the `istio-token` field of `application.yml` with the tokens of other workloads.

=== Routing
==== Component support description

Currently, the routing module only supports some components:

Remote call Component: Spring Cloud OpenFeign

Load balance Component: Ribbon

In the future, more components such as RestTemplate, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and so on will be supported.

==== Using Routing capacity
With the introduction of the transformation adapter of rule, we can obtain the governance rules to give the Spring Cloud application some governance capabilities. Label routing module can route the Spring Cloud application according to the request header, request parameters and other tags to route to different services.

If you use Microservices Governance Label Routing in your project, You need to use a following starter dependency(Generally added to service consumer application):
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-governance-routing</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

2.Configure a load balance algorithm when there are routing rules (RandomRule algorithm as an example)
If no configuration,use default ribbon load balance algorithm ZoneAvoidanceRule.
----
spring.cloud.governance.routing.rule=RandomRule
----

With the introduction of Istio Resource Transform adapter, the label routing module supports routing of the following types of request meta-information:

* Request Path
* Request Header
* Request Param

We use Istio to publish corresponding `DestinationRule` and `VirtualService` to configure corresponding labeled routing rules. For details, see the following documents and examples:

* https://istio.io/latest/zh/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/#VirtualService[Istio VirtualService]
* https://istio.io/latest/zh/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#destination-rules[Istio Destination Rule]
* https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/tree/2.2.x/spring-cloud-alibaba-examples/governance-example/label-routing-example[Spring Cloud Alibaba Routing Examples]

=== Authentication
image::pic/auth-process.png[]

With the introduction of the transformation adapter of rule, we can obtain the governance rules to give the Spring Cloud application some governance capabilities. The Authentication module provides various authentication modes for Spring Cloud applications, such as IP blacklist and whitelist and JWT authentication.

Add following Microservices Authentication starter:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-governance-auth</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

We use Istio to publish corresponding `AuthorizationPolicy` and `RequestAuthentication` to configure corresponding Authentication rules. For details, see the following documents and examples

* https://istio.io/latest/zh/docs/reference/config/security/request_authentication/[Istio RequestAuthentication]
* https://istio.io/latest/zh/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/[Authorization Policy]
* https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/tree/2.2.x/spring-cloud-alibaba-examples/governance-example/authentication-example[Spring Cloud Alibaba Authorization Examples]
